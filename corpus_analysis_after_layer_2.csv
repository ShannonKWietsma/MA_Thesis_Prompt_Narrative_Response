You're not yet ready to drop your guard, but the vampire's statement has piqued your curiosity as well as your confusion. You raise an eyebrow. ""What do you mean?"" You ask. The vampire cocks his head to the side and looks at you with a blank yet...somehow questioning expression. ""You can't tell? Do humans exhibit different social cues in such scenarios?"" Baffled, you look at the three women kneeling around you, and notice the faint blush creeping across the cheeks of the one in the faded blue silk dress. You didn't realize vampires could even blush. You look back at their father, whose expression still appears blank, but you start to see a flicker of movement in the frozen lines of his face. ""If we do, I'm really bad at interpreting them..."" You say, trailing off. You suppose you're just bad at that sort of thing no matter what species you're interacting with. ""Well,"" the vampire says, ""I'll put this as bluntly as I can, then. My daughters—these three, at least—like you. Unfortunately they seem to have forgotten that courting someone, much like entering their house, should involve getting their permission first."" You start sputtering and drop your weapon in surprise. ""What...courting? You mean this whole thing is because they want to—"" ""Make you their bride, yes."" You can't even respond. You look at the three women again, noticing the barest curve of a smile on the one in the forest green leather jacket. The one who appears to have stepped right out of the 1940s glances at you from the corner of her eyes and licks her lips. The one in blue bows her head slightly, hiding her face behind her cascade of fiery curls. Your heart drums wildly at the realization that all three of them want you. And it suddenly dawns on you that maybe you find the shyness of the blue-clad woman a little bit endearing.",myhummingbirdbluelove,reblog,writing-prompt-s,['text'],['text']

Their corrosion will testify against  you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last  days. Look!  The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are  crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the  ears of the Lord Almighty. You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.”  There were shouts of anger. He was grabbed roughly and a sack was shoved over his head before he was hulled out of the royal throne-room. No doubt they were taking him to his very public execution.  He smiled under the sack. It was already too late. The king had forgotten his power came from his people and in the end they could take it back. Everything was in place. A weak chuckle escaped him.

“AH MY EYES! MY EYES!”

The massive Krutashan screamed after the human jumped on its torso, jabbed its thumbs into the eye sockets and then... ran away, leaving the thumbs behind, cackling while already growing a new pair.

Somewhere in his secret lair Dr. Bootlonshnickernicker cackled.

I’m not super great at elevator pitches because every detail feels important, so idk how to really melt it down into a quick summary, especially since I don’t have all the details ironed out yet. Here’s my best attempt right now: 

Once every few years, the Earth God brings forth a demigod known as a Guardian, creations of the Earth God and servants of Elder gods (cryptids from Appalachian and Indigenous American myth). The Elders maintain the order of the universe, and the Guardians are their right arm. Unknown to the Guardians, some of the Elders have shifted their allegiance from the Earth God to its counterpart (name TBD) and are trying to release it from its prison. These Elders are growing bolder in their attempts, and when the Earth God sends a set of twin Guardians for the first time, it’s taken as a sign that the end is coming. When the Guardians learn about the imprisoned God, disagreements over it and the twins threaten to destroy their bond. They can face the traitorous Elders alone, but to face the imprisoned God, they’ll have to find a way to come together, or all will be lost.
(Also omg thank you, it’s a custom of me by Michi @chrysanthemumskies! Their art is gorg and they do a lot of fandom/ship stuff too)

You. Fuck this, I don't wanna be the fucking King of New York,""

She stared towards me, a tall woman with a sword presented towards me. Her eyes were emerald orbs, shining with thousands of colors, and she held a phone in her hand. At my angry insistence, she only laughed a light and soft laugh.

""I've seen the message boards, y'know,"" Her tone was gentle, guiding, ""The angry rants you go on, about how things need to be changed. You incited a rebellion against multiple Republican laws which would stifle Human rights,""

""I...I did Not,"" I insisted, ""There is no fuckin' way that I did something like that, I'm sorry. And I'm not takin' your stupid fuckin' sword,""

She did not insist that I take her blade. Nor did she say any other words. Instead, she stretched out a hand. Within her hand was a number, displayed in golden light. It reached into the millions, hell, maybe even the billions.

""Were you to take my blade, this is the number of good deeds you would do... and these are only the largest, the most influential. Were I to show them all, it would reach into the trillions. You can still refuse, of course, but it would be rather unwise of you,""

I stared towards the lady in the pond ""Fuck. You. Now give me your stupid FUCKING sword,""

She smiled, ""Gladly, our Kindly King of New York,""

""If ya call me that again, I'm stabbing you through the fuckin' ass,""

""As if you'd get the chance,"" She replied with a wink, disappearing into mist.

I was left stuttering, with a sword, and a new destiny unkindly thrust upon me. ",therisingsun777,reblog,writing-prompt-s,['text'],['text']

The teenagers don't need ideas, their parents and schools do. Teens have great ideas. They have the idea to sleep in class because their homework keeps them from sleeping at night. They have the idea to set a ten-minute timer and just pass out in the middle of doing their work so that they're slightly less exhausted when they have to wake up and keep working. They have the idea to take cat naps anytime, anyplace. They have the idea to ignore the hallucinations and horrible intrusive thoughts and the articles saying that sleep deprivation can lead to long term health problems and an early grave. They have the idea to beat the insomnia with drugs and harming themselves or beat the exhaustion with drugs and harming themselves or beat the world with drugs and harming themselves.

They know they are killing their body and spirit, but they don't feel like they have any other option. They have to pass, right? Nothing else matters.

Teenagers need to sleep more: Ideas
Worldwide shutdown of social media platforms after 9PM
Maybe not worldwide actually, this is more of a region based thing, but my point still stands
No more than like, idk, 15 mins of hw for classes? Please?
Everyone in the household should be in bed by 10
School can afford to start at 9 AM
TV Programs (if anyone uses cable anymore) should air random mesmurizing colors and shapes to hypnotize anyone that thinks watching tv at night is a good idea to sleep

Write a story that includes this line, either at the beginning, or the end, or somewhere in between. ",196,wp056r002,"Nothing shocks me, I’m a scientist.

This is just a fact for me. I have seen things that the average person wouldn’t dream of seeing, and that is just from my day to day work.

Of course this results in daily jeers and attempts to prove me wrong from my friends. Its as if they have some sort of competition with themselves to see who can be the first to prove me wrong. I have to come to every gathering prepared for some level of disgusting and strange prank to be presented to me. To have some form of discussion about horrible news or outlandish conspiracy theories brought to my attention. Nothing has ever succeeded much to my small friend group’s disappointment.

Lately, their attempts have strengthened, so it came as no surprise to me when my friend Luke suggested a bit of a field trip one night when I was visiting.

“You ever hear that urban legend about the old doll factory?” He posed the question right at the start of a commercial break. He tried to make it sound casual, taking a sip of his beer and leaning back as if it was a spur of the moment thought. I knew it wasn’t he probably planned this all week.

I considered my answer carefully, “No,” I finally settled on with a smirk.

His smile was enough to let me know phase one of whatever plan he had cooked up was a success. He turned to me and lowered the volume on the television and began to speak. “Well you know about the old factory, the one down by the river off of highway 11 right?”

I nodded leaning back on the couch.

“Well I met this guy the other night who said to be careful never go out there on a trip.”

Urban exploring trip is what he meant. It had become Luke’s ‘thing’ since he started about two months ago. I think he felt like this would bring him on top with trying to shock me. To my annoyance he always tried to tell some strange and mysterious stories he’d heard from a friend of a friend of a friend to me to try to shock me. It never worked for a number of reasons. I was beginning to lose interest in his little game tonight thinking it would just be another far fetched tale from a stranger.

“I ask him why,” Luke continues, “You know me, I love a good ghost story. He tells me of course. Apparently years ago right after it closed some kids went there to play around, boy and girl. They went missing that night and a huge search party went out the next day. Searched all day for them. Right before calling it quits for the night, the uncle decides to go into the grainery just for one more search. Everyone else heads home and he looks around for a while. This is where it get weird though.”

Of course. This is where it always got weird. I roll my eyes slightly. He had no clue what he was talking about.

“So apparently he was looking around for the kids. Looking around with his flashlight you know? The building is completely empty real creepy. Suddenly his flashlight goes out. He smacks it a couple times and it comes back on. In front of him there's this doll. Scary as hell. Factory is closed, why would there be a doll here all of the sudden? Well he picks it up and realizes its the exact image of his niece that went missing. That alone scares the hell out of him, but then he hears this sound. That was enough for him he runs, but apparently when he got back he was they got one more detail out of him. That he saw something in there. Like a monster made of doll parts he said. Everyone thought he was crazy of course, but apparently a bunch of fellow explorers have seen it. They think that’s what took the kids. Creepy as hell right?”

I laugh and shake my head. “If you think that was supposed to be shocking to me--”

“Oh c’mon dude. You’re telling me that wasn’t weird as hell. Like his flashlight goes out and some doll appears.” He takes another swig of beer while giving me a dirty side eye.

“It’s a coincidence. Only non corporeal beings could do something like that.”

“Oh, like you would know.”

I shrug and reach for my own bottle of beer. Out of the corner of my eye I see his face twist. A smile creeps over his lips. Luke had an idea.

“Hey are you busy after this?” He asks.

I flash an annoyed look, “I have work tomorrow.”

“Yeah, yeah, I know. Hey how ‘bout we go to the factory. I can prove to you this story is true.”

“Luke, I have work tomorrow.” I repeat.

“Dude, I know. It won’t be long. I’ll get you home by eleven.”

I stand up and finish my beer then look at him considering the offer. As much as I wanted to say no, I couldn’t pass up a research opportunity like this. “Fine.” I tell him. “Eleven at the latest.”

****

The car ride was quick. Luke didn’t live far from highway 11 so it was a straightforward if not noisy drive. Luke couldn’t seem to keep his excitement at bay and therefore did not keep silent the entire way there.

He already had supplies packed in his trunk. Luke often went urban exploring after his second shift job and kept prepared.

Once we parked, he pulled a bulky backpack out of his bag and pulled some items from it. He handed me a flashlight followed by a pair of gloves and an N95 mask to protect myself from the environment. I threw on what he gave me quickly and he did the same zipping up the pack when he was done and leading the way.

The old factory was nothing special from the outside. It was exactly what one would expect. Broken boarded up windows. Graffiti everywhere. It seemed to just be barely holding itself up at this point. Though the front door was chained closed, I almost felt like one good kick could probably open it based on the state of the material.

Luke had us crawl through a window. It looked like this had been where most people had been entering. Some kind soul had cleared out the glass completely and left a board loosely over it marked with an ‘x’. It was about a 5 foot drop from that window down onto some old machinery. From there it was another 6 or so feet down to the empty factory floor.

The inside was no better than the exterior. I was thoughrouly unimpressed. This was clearly just some place that kids were coming to party. The remnants of a campfire were in the center of the room with trash, including broken booze bottles and other paraphernalia, were strewn on seemingly every other surface of the floor.

“Wow Luke this is really something,” I said, voice dripping with sarcasm. I should’ve known it was a hoax.

“Shut up dude. We just got here. Give it a while I’m sure we’ll find something.” He walked on with determination looking up in the rafters while he did so.

I wandered a little more aimlessly, kicking through the trash seeing if I’d find anything interesting. Of course there was nothing. I moved on to examining the old equipment. That was at least semi-interesting to try to decipher how the old technology worked to create the dolls.

My examination was interrupted by a loud metallic clatter. It sounded like someone had thrown a metal plate from somewhere high above. I turned quickly to see what it had been. Hearing Luke scream I determined quickly it hadn’t been him. Quickly, I made my way towards him and he met me halfway running for his life.

“Bro tell me that was you!” He nearly screamed in my face as he grabbed my arms.

“Of course not!” I hissed. Looking behind him I saw what had been dropped. It looked like some type of large lever from one of the machines. “You think I could lift that?”

He met my eyes with widened ones. “Lets go.” He whispered.

I rolled my eyes, “What happened to proving your point?”

“Forget it let's--” He stopped.

“What?” I said following his gaze behind me. I lifted my eyebrows when I saw what he was looking at. A doll. Sitting perfectly on the machine we had entered on. “Huh.” I said.

I had to admit that was strange. There hadn’t been a single doll in sight since we got here. Pushing away Luke I made my way over to it.

“Bro what are you doing!?” He cried.

“Just looking.” I picked it up. Short black hair and brown eyes. “Doesn’t this kind of look like me?” I chucked turning to show Luke.

“Bro.” Luke said trembling. “We gotta go.”

“Maybe I should keep him. I can put it on my desk at work.”

“Bro.” Luke repeated.

“I think I will.”

“Bro.” Luke repeated once again, urgency clear this time.

“What?” I asked.

He pointed above me not saying a word.

Before I could turn something dropped by my foot. A doll leg.

I turned and saw it.

It was humanoid in shape, but other than that it resembled nothing of a human. It was as if a mannequin and a voodoo doll had a child. Limbs made of uneven stitched together fabric. A porcelain head looking down at me with cracked, yet shockingly blue eyes. Tangled locks of golden plastic hair framing its face and running down its cloth body.

My eyes widened when it spoke. “F-f-freind?” It’s voice was a hissing croak.

I wasn’t given any more time to think on the situation. Luke grabbed my arm with such ferocity and speed I thought he was going to rip it off when he started running. He pulled me along causing me to drop my doll when I stumbled trying to keep up with him. We couldn’t leave the way we came in from, but he quickly found another escape route. In the old offices in the back there was a window at a more reasonable level. He pulled me in slamming the door shut behind us before punching out the remnants of a previously broken window. We got through without a problem, our pursuer never coming close to finding us. We were in Luke’s car and leaving the plot before I knew it and on our way home.

The ride home was a stark contrast to the ride there. Silent and tense. When we pulled back into Luke’s driveway we sat quiet for a moment. He rested his head against the steering wheel and trembled.

“You okay buddy?” I asked finally.

He looked up at me with a weak smile on his face, “Y-yeah.” He stumbled out. “That was pretty cool huh? Surprised you?”

I puckered my lips. “No not really.” I said honestly.

Luke did not like that answer.

*****

“You look tired, kid.” My boss gave me a slap on the back startling me the next morning at work.

I turned away briefly from my coffee making to give him a nod. “Oh yeah,” I said, “My friend was trying to make a point again. Took me out to go ghost hunting.”

My boss chuckled, “Well did he win his bet. Find anything shocking?”

I just shook my head, “Just a homunculus. Strange to find one in an old factory. I feel bad for it. I think it’s lonely.”

My boss nodded. “Well I think we can arrange a pick up. We need more homunculi for the lab anyway. Give me details at the meeting.”

I smiled, “Thank you sir.”

“Even though you’re tired I expect you to finish your report on the nightcrawlers by noon.”

“Of course sir.”

He turned to leave but stopped for a moment, “Are you ever planning on telling your friends what you actually do?”

I laughed, “Of course not. All they have to know is that I’m a scientist and nothing shocks me.” #my writing#long post#lmk what yall think i was bored in quarentine and did this for fun",babymoonbee,reblog,writingprompts,"['text', 'link']","['hashtags', 'text']"

Who thought that combining sugar and a radical new compound that didn’t even have a name yet would create a blast so big that it blew up almost the entire room?

It was all an accident, really. The flask had (unwisely, she knew) been next to her coffee mug and all she wanted was just a tad sweeter cup when instead of being dumped into the wonderful, delightful, life-giving elixir--

It was dumped into a jar that shouldn’t have been on her desk.

And there was an explosion.

Annabelle didn’t know how she survived being knocked pretty hard into the concrete wall behind her, but she had. Her dignity? Not so much.

She looked dazedly up at the ceiling, birds almost visible flying in a circle above her head. Shaking her head only made them more visible, so she stopped doing that.

“Oh, sugar, what have I done,” she muttered under her breath, levering herself up to sitting.

“I think you’ve blown up your work station, for one.”

Annabelle squeezed her eyes shut tight and tried to imagine that the statement had come from nowhere and no one.

“Don’t try to ignore me, Annabelle, you southern belle disguised as a scientist,” the voice came again.

Annabelle sighed. “I’m sorry, Cam. I really didn’t realize what I was doing.”

Cam scoffed. “Apparently not.” She dusted her hands against the fronts of her legs and then folded her arms. “What are you going to do next?”

Annabelle winced. “Clean it up?”

“Are you sure you’re a scientist?” Cam asked, incredulous. “You’re to write it down and see if you can figure out how and why it happened.”

“R-really? I’m not in trouble?” Annabelle asked. 

“Oh, no, you’re in trouble,” Cam said. “This is all you’ll be researching for the foreseeable future. And you’ll be the first one in and the last one out for a good few months. But you’re a scientist. This is what you do.”

“Cam, I don’t--”

“Don’t understand?” Cam sighed. “Most discoveries are serendipitous. Accidental. This could be something even more powerful than gun powder. You’re to figure out if it is. Why it is. How it is.” She shook her head. “Jesus, what are they teaching you in universities these days?”

Annabelle shrank in on herself. “I’m sorry.”

“There’s nothing to be sorry for, unless you count the scorch marks on the walls.” Cam moved towards her and extended out her hand. “Now come on, get up, get over your shock, and start working.”

Annabelle put her hand in hers and ignored the blush that was surely over-taking her face. “I know shock does silly things to a person. Do you need anything, Cam?”

Cam laughed. “Nothing shocks me.” She grinned. “I’m a scientist.” #posts by fitz #science fiction #sci fi #my writing #annabelle #i might bring annabelle back for more scientist stories #writerblr #short story a day",buying-the-space-farm,reblog,writingprompts,"['text', 'link']","['hashtags', 'text']"

He’s sitting there, in that lab stool of his, much like an adult version of a highchair. Really if you were to ask me, I would say that he get the safety features added, it would greatly benefit him.

I am a new project, supposed to follow him around the day, recording his daily adventures and mis happenings in the lab (the latter were quiet a few). He’s hunched over a triangular flask now, carefully adding droplets of some clear liquid into another clear liquid. I zoom in.

One. Two. Three drops. He picks up the flask and carries it to the hooded chamber, I don’t know what it’s called but it makes an awful noise when turned on, like a faulty exhaust fan.

The chamber is set up with a black backdrop, and another camera recording straight on. He’s humming some upbeat song. Oh. This means something interesting is about to happen. I adjust my focus. He taps his feet, reading the label on the back of some bottle. He’s a chemist shouldn’t he have all this committed to memory?

I’m hoping today is an explosion day, the past few hours have not been exciting and rewarding for me, just recording his silly face and silly hands doing mundane tasks. I think he keeps me here because he gets lonely—the boy even talks to me sometimes; I don’t even have a working microphone!

A noise comes from the entrance, his friend walks in. “I brought lunch, babe!” The friend says.

“You’re right on time, darling,” he replies. “Remember this project I had been telling you about a few weeks ago? The spiderman-webs-nylon video?”

“…Yes?” his friend replies, setting the bag of food on a nearby counter. His eyebrows are pinched.

“Yes well, you’re just about to witness the first run of it!” He flourishes his arm towards the flask, sitting next to huge bottle in a noisy chamber.

“This is not the first time. Honey, the last time you tried this you blew it up.”

“This time will be different.” He insists, pulling on his gloves.

He walks towards the chamber. “All I have to do is add these two together and stir slowly.""

""Is this chemistry or alchemy?”

“Slowly is the key word.” He does as said, the ticks of the clock prominent to me, who has been waiting for this moment of great excitement in my day.

“I-,” he stammers. “This was supposed to work!”

“Don’t sound so shocked, I told you that last time.” His friend says.

“Pfft,” he says. “I’m a scientist, nothing shocks me.” #writing prompt #writing #writersofig #writerscommunity #short story

“A paste. A light, greenish-grey paste. A very special paste. Inside this strange mush are vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, absolutely every single nutrient the human body needs. One cup (something very easy to measure and adjust due to the fluidity of the substance) contains exactly 2,000 calories. Not one drop is empty. It never spoils. Literally the perfect human meal.”

“I’m sorry, what?” Cass furrowed her brow. “You have this magical, physics-defying bowl and that’s all you came up with?”

“Think about it!” I leaned closer over the diner table. The ceramic of the bowl rattled as it shook, but the paste inside would never spill. “Think of how fast-paced most people’s lives are! How many times have you gotten home from a long day at work and truly wanted to make dinner for yourself?”

Cass pushed out her lower lip and bobbed her head. “Never.”

“Never!” I repeated. “Because who the hell wants to get done making their boss dollars for dimes to immediately spend an hour and a half chopping and cooking and cleaning before they can actually start enjoying their evening?”

“I’m pretty sure some people actually like cooking, Beth.”

“Some, yeah, but not me.” 

Cass narrows her eyes, starting to recognize what you’re saying before quickly shaking her head. “Most of the time you end up making one of those frozen pizzas or getting fast food, anyway.”

I started wagging my finger. I’d almost gotten her. “But both of those options are terrible for you! That’s the shittiness of it! Anything convenient is almost always going to tear us apart from the inside out. To make something healthy, you have to put in a ton of time and effort, and if you’re not a good cook, you’ll likely eat a bland mess for all your troubles! Getting food that’s convenient, healthy, and tastes decent is always way too expensive for normal people.”

“You know, you make a good point actually.” Cass’s eyes go a bit wider.

“I eat a cup and that’s it. I’m set for the day. I feel great, I don’t gain or lose any weight, I feel full, and it even tastes good! It’s just a nice mild vanilla flavor.”

“I’ll miss eating in this diner with you, then.” She shrugged with a disappointed smile. 

I grinned from ear to ear. “That’s the beauty of it! I can still eat at the diner with you! I can still eat other things, I just don’t have to every single goddamn day!”

Cass perks up. “Seems like you’ve thought of almost everything,” she said, “you know, I’m sure you’re not the only one who thinks that way. I don’t mind cooking and finding food for myself, but even I wouldn’t mind some paste just in case I’m late for work in the morning.”

“And I have an unlimited amount, don’t I?” I looked down at the bowl, still just as full of paste as when I first filled it.

Cass and I met eyes, then both nodded our heads as the realization clicked. 

*****

“I’ll have the coney dog, please,” Cass pointed to her menu, making sure to project her voice so the waitress could hear her in the noisy diner.

“I’ll have the same,” I said with a nod.

The waitress nodded at the both of them, a few more frazzled strands of hair shaking out of her bun. She then rushed to the next table, making sure to help everyone in her packed section.

Cass sighed fondly. “Remember when this place was empty most of the time?”

I shrugged a little. “Kind of our fault, isn’t it?”

She held up her palms and looked to the ground. “Listen, I’m not the one who got the magic bowl, don’t blame me.”

I giggled. “You were the one who suggested I start selling the stuff!”

“Liar, it was both of us!” Cass laughs as she pointed at a booth on the other side of the diner. “We were in that very booth and we came up with it together!”

“I never would have guessed restaurants would start seeing more business, I figured this place would die.”

“People have more money now, I guess. They can treat themselves more often than they used to when it only costs them five bucks for a week’s worth of food.” Cass looks around the diner, nodding with satisfaction at the sight of all the happy, guilt-free people enjoying the atmosphere of the quaint little greasy spoon.

I sat back and folded my arms. “Who would have thought five years could change so much?”

“Well, five years plus a reality-bending anomaly.”

“Yeah, I suppose that’ll speed things up,” I chuckled, “seems like we did good from where we’re sitting.” 

Right then I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. A woman at a nearby table kept glancing at them. She kept checking her phone, narrowing her eyes, and making the motion as if zooming in on something. One of the two men sitting with her stretched, turning his head just enough to look at Cass and me. Of the three of them, none had any food, only mostly full cups of coffee. I also took note that they were still wearing their coats.

“Even if we did make a few enemies,” Cass admits. 

“Speaking of which,” I muttered, “eight o’clock.”

Cass fiddled with the napkin dispenser, turning it until the polished metal reflected what was behind her. “I suppose we’re due for another attempt, aren’t we? What’s it been, a week since the last one?”

“Nine days.” I frowned. “Damn it, two days from our record, too.”

“Who do you think sent them this time?”

Cass rubbed her chin. “Insulin manufacturers? We haven’t seen them in a while.”

“Nah, I think they’re putting all their resources into lobbying right now. I’m thinking it’s McHitmen.”

“Jesus Christ, again?” She rolls her eyes. “That fucking clown is relentless.”

I click my tongue. “I guess that’s what happens when you get that rich. Even when business plummets you’re still rich enough to hire assassins.”

“And of course, going non-profit means we don’t have the money for bodyguards.”

“Like we need them after how much we’ve been training.” I winked at her. “Ambush them?”

Cass smiled. “Lead the way.”

As we stood from our booth, the table of mercenaries tensed. They didn’t get up with us quite yet, they thought they were subtle. After leaving enough cash on the table for our coffees and the meals we’d, unfortunately, have to abandon, we strode out the door and into the alley next to the restaurant. We slipped into a side passage and watched the sunset shadows of the cars going by on the busy main street we’d just come from. Soon enough, we saw the elongated forms of three figures approaching.

“Leave one breathing this time,” I whispered to Cass, “It’s time to strike back against these assholes. I’m sick of my them interrupting my lunches.”

As a hero, I know I'm meant to be saving the world or saving the city but since Venton, master of invention, as he calls himself, killed my father I find even getting myself out of bed hard to do. If I'm honest though, even Venton seems less motivated. He destroys a few buildings, sees that I'm not coming to defend the people and quickly reverses any damage he's done. Life just doesn't have consequences any more. I pull myself from looking out the window, shuffle to my lounge and turn on the TV. I run my hand over my mangy facial hair as the screen springs to life, the news was on. ""We interrupt this program to announce that Venton, the criminal mastermind is destroying buildings again. In recent months the self proclaimed evil genius has periodically destroyed a few apartments on the south side of town. The city questions, where is our local hero? Where is Spring man?""

Months go by. My routine stays. Wake up, watch TV, order food, eat small amounts then drink myself to sleep. Life rolls on and every day Venton destroys less and less. Today he hasn't shown up, its 5pm and normally he starts destroying things at 9am. Hell the explosion sounds work as an alarm clock for me. I drag myself off the couch, every movement excruciatingly exhausting. The door was only steps away but I didn't know how to muster the strength to get there. As I was just about to give up and drop myself to the floor in melancholy, my door opens. In the doorway stood a person clad all in black, carrying a rather large breafcase. I studied the figure lazily. Smooth blonde hair swept back hurriedly accentuated with thin, professional glasses poised over deep green eyes. This man was surprisingly muscular for someone playing dress up. Then, in disappointment the figure spoke in a deep booming voice, ""Really Spring? I spend almost a year destroying buildings to get your attention and you ignore me to become this?"" He was right though, Venton could clearly see my mottled dark hair greasy and knotted to my shoulders, mangy beard with red welts from scratching at sweat rashes, thinner than is realistically healthy from malnutrition. I stared at my arch nemesis with dead, lifeless blue eyes and whispered, ""What the..."" as I dropped to the floor and quickly passed out.

I awoke in a laboratory hooked to a machine pumping me full of bright purple liquid. I looked around but everything seemed hazy. From the corner of the room came a gentle but deep voice, ""Relax old rival, I don't wish to harm you. I've been trying to get you out to bring you here to witness my new invention. The reviver will bring your father back to life. However, you don't have the strength right now to handle the shock. You're lucky I anticipated this state of yours and quickly made a serum to bring you back to full strength and better in a matter of 24 hours.""

""But why would you..."" came my lazy voice in a haze of confusion.

“Yup.”

“I could have gotten a tiny elephant!”

“Or a giraffe. Or a rhino. Or a...”

“If you were about to say hippopotamus, know that I WILL FUCK YOU UP! You know I always wanted a hippopotamus.”

The laughter my brother had so diligently kept under wraps spilled out, first as one solitary snort, and as if taken off guard by his own sound, Tam lost control. One moment I had been sitting across from him, and the very next, he had tumbled to the ground, body tossing and turning with the force of his guffaws.

My mini pet padded over to investigate. She cocked her head, observing Tam before making a leap that would surely have spelt death in the wild. I’d named her Letha, short for Lethalia, an ode to her true nature.

“You could have made a fortune displaying a tiny hippopotamus,” he wheezed out, back still flat and now acting as cushion for Letha.

“Pets are family. You know how I feel about putting animals to work.”

He raised his torso to quirk a cynical eyebrow at me. The movement jostled Letha and she made an unhappy noise. 

We froze. See, the only thing that she’d retained from her old form, apart from her demeanour, was her formidable sound. 

Shaking off the instinctive fear that had gripped my spine, I said, “But an appearance on Jimmy Fallon wouldn’t be so bad, I guess.”

“I thought as much,” he said, the tone making his amusement apparent. 

I got off my chair and walked over to poke Tam’s flank with my toe in retaliation.

Letha growled again. The rumble, once again, had my heart racing and feet itching to step backwards, and break into a run.

I sat down next to my brother to appease her with rubs and scritches.

“How can anyone mistake a lioness for a house cat?”

My brother’s fingers joined mine in serving the queen of the jungle. 

He said, “It’s mankind’s way. A glorious beast stands before them, but without the savannah’s savage backdrop, and without their blood staining ochre, they see a tamed cat they can pet.” #writing prompt fill #writer #indian #i'm bored #i wish i could write like donna tartt #she looks like a distant relative of the Addams family #feminism #feminist #short story #flash fiction

Of course, authors are the seers of reality, and once Steinbeck gave his diagnosis, science moved in. I wonder what they felt back then, when the control panel was revealed to the world. 

The history sites only tell us about the wars that were fought. First, those who wanted control vs those who were against altering the natural order. Then, those who wanted autonomy against those who believed settings should be moderated by Oversight.  

We almost didn’t make it through the autonomy war.  

These days, Oversight intercedes when someone is unable to moderate themselves. They dial down impulses in the criminally minded, dial up empathy in those who are wired to hurt others.   

When I was young, I had a friend who was prone to emotional outbursts. I never knew whether Grey would be happy or sad, angry or elated. I didn’t care. I loved him because of his struggle, not despite it. My parents warned me not to associate with him, that he would only bring me down with him. All I knew was he was beautiful. That he could paint through his pain. That the world was a better place for his creative visions.  

His neurology was incompatible with the chip we all have implanted with the onset of puberty. I tried to help him the same way I’d helped myself. He refused to let me alter his controls.  

Oversight took him away, and when they brought him back, he never picked up a paintbrush again. Six months later, we buried him. 

That was when I realized that Oversight is not the protector I had been taught they were. That there is no place for neurodiversity in the plan they have for humanity.  

I think and I feel. I see potential, not the reality. I live in hope, not fear. I see the world through a lens of color and emotion.  

They will never find out who I really am. 

I walk into the Oversight Institute every day. I sit at my desk. I read through case files. I save the artists.

She was pointing to a small blue object, too distant to make out just yet. But they were traveling pretty quickly, and soon enough his eyes adjusted to the shape as they careened by. It passed below them in a near-blur, becoming distant again behind them in a mere blink of the eye.

''It was a car.''

''Oh.''

The girl then pointed to another object. Red this time. Just as before it was too far to really understand what it was just yet, but soon enough they passed over it and the man was able to smile.

''That,'' he clicked his teeth, ''was a boat.''

''Oh.''

There was nothing for a long time, just the inky black and the sense that they were traveling quickly forwards. She'd long since stopped trying to grab at the nothingness with her little hands for purchase. Their forward motion was perpetual, unending, and if I were to be fully honest, at a relatively safe speed. No more than eighty miles per hour, I assure you.

Her hair streamed behind her by the ever-present wind, and she winced once again as a piece whipped around and slapped her across the eyes. It stung and she was tired of reaching up to fix it.

She didn't understand how the man beside her looked completely still even in all of the wind; if she were older and had a better vocabulary, she'd be able to explain why his stillness unnerved her so much after all this time. But she was only five. And such thoughts weren't conducive to the problem at hand. So she kept reminding herself that it wasn't important and to focus on the bigger things.
Namely, the fact that they had been doing this for far too long, and she was far too tired, and she just wanted to go home. Her mother was probably very angry by now. She was sure she had missed more than one dinner by this point.

She wondered if her dad had made it home. He'd been with her, in the beginning. A lot of people had, actually, but one by one they had dissolved until only she and the man remained. When would it be her turn? She's been so very patient and understanding, why couldn't she just go home too?

''How much longer?'' she whined around a yawn. ''I hate this.''

''Not much longer now,'' the man soothed. If he could, he would have pat her head for comfort. He hated dealing with the tiny ones.

Oh, he wasn't scared of children. He dealt with children all the time. It was just... the tiny ones always made him a little sad. His chest always bloomed with a bruise when he had to take a tiny one. 

The same kind of bruise you would feel in your chest if you were to, say, see a puppy be hit by a semi going one-hundred-twelve miles per hour on the freeway. Graphic? Yes. Mentally scarring? Oh, most assuredly. But you'd also be able to take solace in the fact that it was a quick and sort-of painless death, right? I mean, who really feels being hit by a semi at one-hundred-twelve miles per hour? You're liquefied within seconds. Not much pain in that.

''What's that?''

A purple object.

''Ah,'' the man breathed a sigh of relief. ''That's your stop.''

They were still moving forward, but as the purple object drew close it somehow managed to keep pace with them. It was her dad's car. Flying just as quickly as they were, just below them, in all its grapey glory.

She'd never been happier to see her dad's purple car.

She looked over at the man.

''But how do I st--'' As she spoke the man had turned towards her and raised his leg behind him in a funny way. Like one of the footballer's her mom liked to watch on the television.

And then he kicked her before she could even finish her question. Square in the butt. And she went flying towards--

''She's alive! She's alive!''

Olivia opened her eyes. A man was holding her aloft like a trophy. Her dad's purple car was a blurry blob behind him as he walked up a sharp incline and passed her over to more hands. Her head hurt too much to keep her eyes open so she shut them again. Her head lolled towards the side. Her cheeks stung with the movement, still chapped from the hours of wind.

She was placed on something soft but thin. Everything was too loud. Too bright, even with her eyes closed.

She still felt as if she were flying.

I always avoided it. Never even looked at it, in fear that it would, one day, look back. That one day finally came. I told Pa how scared I was of the tall grass, how it whispered in the wind. In Pa's words, I should ""grow up"" and ""face my fears to help an old lady."" Despite my protest, He insisted that I take Ms. Marsh the bag of tattered garments, as she was an old seamstress and could not acquire the clothing on her own accord. Finally giving up, I travel down the gravel road to Ms. Marsh's house. I made sure to take our dog, Lucky. He tended to comfort me in times of stress, and I was stressed. The thing about Ms. Marsh's house is that you had to pass the tall grass to make it there. That's what made the journey difficult. Still, I went. I thought maybe, ""It wouldn't be so bad."" Boy, was I wrong. Before I knew it, I was in front of the grass. I held Lucky's collar tightly as I walked with my head down. I walked at a fast pace, making sure not to drop the bag of garments in the process. I could hear faint whispering coming from the grass as I walked. My breathing became heavy, but I reminded myself I was almost past the grass. That's when I came to a sudden halt by Lucky. He had stopped and was obviously bothered by something in the grass.  The grass began to rustle as if something were to appear out of it. Before anything had the chance to come out, I picked up Lucky by his torso and ran. He barked until we were finally past the grass. For a moment, when running, I thought the grass had shaken. Approaching Ms. Marsh's house, I was out of breath. Lucky was a big dog weighing about one-sixty. The bag was at least twenty pounds. I weighed about forty pounds less than that. So you can imagine that wasn't easy. I walked up the steps of Ms. Marsh's porch. Her porch was always cluttered with random junk that Pa helped her move from time to time.  I ring the doorbell and wait for Ms. Marsh to come out. Soon after, she walks out and greets me with a small but cheery ""Hello, dear."" Somewhat still out of breath, I greet her. I show her the bag of garments loosely hanging out the bag and ask her where she would like me to put them. ""This table here is fine,"" she says as she points to the kitchen table behind her. I began to walk inside the house when I look back to see Lucky. He wasn't following me inside. In fact, he didn't even take a step onto the porch. He started acting weird ever since we approached the house. Despite this, I still went inside. Almost immediately, I notice the state of the interior. Cups scattered across countertops, books fallen off shelves, and a strange aroma that I couldn't exactly name. I set the bag on the table and turned to the door. I was stopped by Ms. Marsh asking me if ""I had to leave so soon."" I told her Pa needed me home, so I had to get going. This was a lie. Pa never said I had to come home at any specific time, but I did not want to walk home in the dark. After telling Ms. Marsh I had to go, I took Lucky and left. Not long after we left, we were back where we began, In front of the grass. A feeling of dread washed over me. I walked faster than before, free from the burden of the bag weighing me down. Suddenly, I heard a low bellow. I look and move towards the grass as if it was calling me. I froze. It was Ms. Marsh. She looked at me with wide eyes and bellowed in the same low tone I heard before. It felt like hours before I was broken from my stare by noise. I hadn't noticed Lucky's rapid barking or the man peering out of his car, screaming at me to get out of the road. I move out of the way, allowing the man to pass. I look back at the grass to find Ms. Marsh gone. What had I seen? Whatever it was, whoever it was, didn't matter. I ran. I ran home and didn't bother looking back. When I finally made it home, I let out a sigh of relief. I didn't tell Pa what happened or what I saw 'cause I knew he wouldn't believe me. I sat on the porch with Lucky, recollecting my thoughts. After all that happened, I could only ask one thing. Where was Ms. Marsh? #thriller #my writing #writing prompt #slay ig #psychological thriller #i like writing #sometimes #when im not procrastinating on projects #i dont really like this #ehhhhhh #I took me 7 hours to write this#because#i#procrastinate#teehee#hope u like it#if u dont#oh well",rustyonrye,reblog,dropkickwritersblock,['text'],"['hashtags', 'text']"

She let the cord slip through her scarred fingers. The cord was as black as her long hair, contrasted by the milky white crescent moon dangling on it everyday. 

“It was mom’s.” She said with sentiment. Her wet eyes and sad smile studied the carved stone.

Willow looked in the mirror. She saw her doppelgänger’s hand stretched out toward herself. The necklace was simple, a round crescent moon with markings carved into it.

She she outstretched her arm beneath the other and let the necklace fall. She then studied it closely. She could see the imperfections now, little chips and dirt built up over the years. Beneath it there was a marbling effect, by a trick of the light it almost glowed.

Willow looked back into the reversed glass. She saw herself once again, but different. The hair on her head was white and cut short, framing her face.

“What do I do with this?” She asked, met only with silence.

With no answer, Willow put the cord around her neck and clasped the silver pieces together. The cold stone fell and hung against her skin. Willow stared into the mirror.

Sure, they weren't exactly native to Hue's small town, but they were sure pretty to look at as you rode by on a bicycle. Kids could be seen picking them the first few days, making tiny, tight-fisted bouquets for their parents or friends. Hue even sat with his little sister Mary and taught her how to make a crown from them by poking a hole in the stem with his nail and pulling another stem through.

It didn't alarm anyone as the flowers spread. Flowers do that. They hopped from one fence to the other, one yard to the next--you could even track their growth by putting your fingers up to your eye. In only a few hours time they'd travel a finger-width, by the next day they'd be four fingers past. And so on and so forth. 

Not everyone liked them; Mrs. Talbot, for example, complained about them every day as Hue walked Mary to school. She'd pull them from her vegetable patch and hold them aloft like she'd finally gotten vengeance and held the head of her worst enemy.  Mr. Lonnie and Mr. Giles, on the other hand, made tea from them they claimed was good for blood circulation and chronic pain. It looked red and smelled terrible.

It took a couple of months for the poppies to cover every inch of grass, choking the life from anything smaller than a sapling. They took over abandoned toys and started to climb fences just around the same time the town called a meeting to address the situation. Regular weed-killers just weren't cutting it and poor Mrs. Talbot had long ago given up the fight--she couldn't pull them out fast enough before more grew to take their place.

Walking Mary to school across concrete sidewalks became piggy-back rides through the growing froth of green and red. The idyllic wonder of a seven year-old was the only thing keeping Hue from the panic that was starting to consume everyone else. 

Some people left, packing up their things and leaving their doors wide open as they drove off into the unknown. But it wasn't just their town. It was the entire county. And it only seemed to be getting worse; the local news kept track with their own special radar. Every day Hue watched the red shape grow wider and wider as it swallowed them up whole.

They had completely taken over by the fifth month. Poppies, a sea of red, black, green, and yellow. Townies had to use machetes to get from one door to the next. Paths were cut daily from house to house, store to store, just so people could get through and live their lives pretending everything was normal. That harmless, thoughtless flowers hadn't taken over and everyone was alright.

The local crops had dried-up. The country was focusing on stopping the spread, not helping the people already affected, and food was scarce as they built a wall to keep the poppies--and the people--in. There were no evacuation efforts. They'd all been left to slowly starve to death.

What wildlife was left had been hunted and eaten. Not even the herbivores could be kept alive subsisting off of only poppies. Fighting was normal, now. Neighbors were no longer helping each other reach their mailbox in the tough tangling vines.

Hue packed up what little they had and took Mary into the last of the trees that used to make up an endless forest. It was eerie, how little noise there was now. No bird calls. No skittering squirrels. Just... quiet.

''What happens when there's no one left?'' Mary asked one night as they stared up at the stars. The trees were gone, left behind somewhere in the miles they'd walked. There was nothing out here except the poppies. At least they made a soft bed.

Hue traced a faint line in the air, connecting one star to another like a connect-the-dots drawing. His stomach growled, low and hungry, but their reserves had long-since dried up. He knew he would have to resort to desperate measures soon.

''I don't know.''

Mary's face, so thin and gaunt now, didn't look right in the darkness. The moon's light bounced off her skin in a way that made her look as if she were glowing from the inside.

''I'm hungry,'' she whispered.

''I know.''

Stay in the castle unless performing her duties. - Her mother’s wicked advisor runs the castle these days, and far worse there is a world outside that calls to her. A world that holds her brother, her friend, and her precious one. The walls of the castle feel more like a prison every day, and the crown a manacle keeping her there.
And most importantly: OBEY. - Obey Mother, obey Aether’s High Queen, even when it breaks her heart. Even if it hurts. Even when it hurts those she loves. Lillie must obey.
She sets the crown on her nightstand and looks at it with purest hate. This crown has taken everything from her, and it will keep taking from her forever. It’s stolen her freedom, her love, her light... Wouldn’t it be better if it was destroyed? It’s pretty now, but wouldn’t it be better in a million shiny pieces?

Smash the crown! a voice that sounds deceptively like her brother’s whispers in her mind. Smash it and run away to be free!
 And Lillie wants to. She wants so very badly to smash the accursed hunk of metal and flee Aether’s shores, never to look back. Find Sun, and flee to another region across the sea. Perhaps find the boy’s forgotten homeland, and live out their lives there. Sun’s skill in battle can’t be disputed, it wouldn’t be hard to make a living in an arena.

If she was gone, Hau would no longer be expected to marry her, and under Melemele’s laws, he could wed her brother.

Lillie lifts up her crown, and she almost, almost, smashes it into the wall. Almost decides to leave and reclaim her freedom, her love, and her light. But... But she remembers her last night with Sun. When, at Mother’s insistence, she told the young man that their time together had meant nothing, and that it was merely a moment’s entertainment for a princess to briefly lower herself to consort with a commoner.

She remember his beautiful brown eyes, so full of pain, as he demanded to know what he’d done wrong. As he’d called after as she’d walked away, refusing to turn around lest he see her tears, begging her to come back. Lillie hurt him so terribly that night, and she knows she can never take it back. She can’t go reclaim him, because he stopped being hers in that instant.

And so with a heart so much heavier than the crown could ever be, she reaches for the accursed adornment and places it back atop her head. It is what she deserves, and it is what she is. A cold, hurtful thing. Aether’s Crown Princess. #pokemon #lightsunshipping #sunflowershipping #lillie #sun

Where the hell are you even getting those?""

My nemesis, that Clara, always asked too many questions.

""When life gives you lemons, I guess...""

When I woke up, there was a lemon in my hand.

While utterly confused, I simply added it to my fruit bowl, while privately wondering to myself if I had had bought that lemon yesterday. 

After I had dressed, I felt an odd lump in my pocket. 

Another lemon.

I took it out.

Another lemon?
At this point, I had to do something with my newfound (as of now) unlimited citrus. 

And so, I visited Clara. 

Clara was the leader of the gang of girls who had bullied me mercilessly when I was in middle school, all the way up to my senior year. 

And I knew where she lived.

Knock, knock.
""Hello? Oh, it's you."" Her eyes, friendly when opening the door, quickly switched to a glare, her smile to a sneer.

""It's nice to see you too, Clara! Hasn't it been a while?"" 

I didn't wait for a response, pointing a knife I had with me directly at her throat. 

""You do what I say, or you know what happens. Now be quiet, and get in the house.""

While she yelped as soon as the blade grazed her throat, she followed.

""Sit.""

I was irritated to see how well-off my former tormenter was doing.

I sat opposite Clara, eyeing her carefully.

""Make one move-""

She nodded. 

I took out the lemon from my pocket.

Still watching Clara, I sliced it open. 

Another lemon.

Sliced.

Repeat.

The ever-growing pile of lemons evidently frightened Clara.

After a while, the pile was large enough.

""Clara.""

She looked at me, terrified of what was coming.

""Do you know the extent of the damage you did to me?""

""I'm so-""

""You aren't.""

I picked up a lemon half and squirted the juice into her eyes.

Clara screamed in agony.

""Do you know how many times I screamed like that because of what you and your gang did?""

""I'M SORRY! I-""

Another half.

""AAAAAAAGHHHHH-""

""Do you remember?""

I stood over her now, watching the figure of the girl who had so tormented me then cower in pain.

""IT WAS YEARS AGO, YOU BITCH-""

Another half.

""I will make you regret those years. I will remind you of every little thing you did to me, so every memory is seared into your brain, as it is mine.""
Perhaps, when this was over, if I didn't get into prison, I could make a living from these lemons.

Hm, or I could corrode the prison bars.

Either way, tonight was going to be fun.

To stop her ascension, her ""apotheosis"" whatever that means. It can't be true Josh – wildviciousmonstrouslobo – would never hurt her. For all the madness and rage he turns loose in the other world, he's never once laid an unwelcome finger on her or anyone else that wasn't threatening her or their friends. But if he found out about this... prophecy... proclaiming it's his destiny to try and kill her, it could very well break him. She knows he never would, but he's been slightly afraid of himself ever since Fenrir tore himself loose of his soul. To learn he's meant to kill her might tarnish the faith in himself he's finally managed to build. She can't bear losing him. Not to cultists – joshsbodyisbrokentheresbloodtheressomuchblood – or to the emptiness and self loathing the disgusting woman from the church left behind when she tore away his innocence – she knows that her love occasionally feels like a real monster, unlovable and unclean – because she loves him just as deeply.

Eventually though, she would crack, and all of the confusing feelings would come spilling out, rapid fire, one after another, faster than he could respond or even begin to calm her down. Maybe she didn’t need to be calm - maybe he needed to be honest. But could he possibly explain the way he felt? The things she brought out of him that scared him. The feelings he never believed could be real; feelings that, even as he felt them, he feared were simply a prelude to agony, if things didn’t work out… The way he was afraid of letting her down, or hurting any part of her. The ways he was afraid that he wasn’t enough for her, even as he reassured her she wasn’t too much… To him, it felt like the right thing to do, to stop anything before it started. Sometimes he lost his resolve, and opened up to her. And then he would remember his fears and reel it all back in, leaving her in a state of constant uncertainty.  He wanted to love her. He wanted to protect her. He didn’t know how to do both, so he always landed on rejecting her. Even though it meant never having her. Pushing her away. Losing her.

No matter the cost to him. And that is why Jazz can't tell him what those cultist creeps said. That Josh – her Josh – only exists to kill her. To stop her ascension, her ""apotheosis"" whatever that means. It can't be true Josh – wildviciousmonstrouslobo – would never hurt her. For all the madness and rage he turns loose in the other world, he's never once laid an unwelcome finger on her or anyone else that wasn't threatening her or their friends. But if he found out about this... prophecy... proclaiming it's his destiny to try and kill her, it could very well break him. She knows he never would, but he's been slightly afraid of himself ever since Fenrir tore himself loose of his soul. To learn he's meant to kill her might tarnish the faith in himself he's finally managed to build. She can't bear losing him. Not to cultists – joshsbodyisbrokentheresbloodtheressomuchblood – or to the emptiness and self loathing the disgusting woman from the church left behind when she tore away his innocence – she knows that her love occasionally feels like a real monster, unlovable and unclean – because she loves him just as deeply.

She couldn’t understand the ways he went hot and cold with her. It frustrated her even as she smiled and wanted to make the most of their time together. Eventually though, she would crack, and all of the confusing feelings would come spilling out, rapid fire, one after another, faster than he could respond or even begin to calm her down. Maybe she didn’t need to be calm - maybe he needed to be honest. But could he possibly explain the way he felt? The things she brought out of him that scared him. The feelings he never believed could be real; feelings that, even as he felt them, he feared were simply a prelude to agony, if things didn’t work out… The way he was afraid of letting her down, or hurting any part of her. The ways he was afraid that he wasn’t enough for her, even as he reassured her she wasn’t too much… To him, it felt like the right thing to do, to stop anything before it started. Sometimes he lost his resolve, and opened up to her. And then he would remember his fears and reel it all back in, leaving her in a state of constant uncertainty.  He wanted to love her. He wanted to protect her. He didn’t know how to do both, so he always landed on rejecting her. Even though it meant never having her. Pushing her away. Losing her. He loved her more than anything, and always vowed to do whatever he could to protect her. No matter the cost to him.

I could feel it trailing behind me like a shadow, just out of sight, but ever present. There are two of him. He and I both know it. One of him is madly in like with me. And one of him, earnestly pushes me away. I always know which one I’m dealing with. I’m always a bit sad when I have to earn back the one who wants me. Even still, there is this part of me who craves the game. I hate feeling things go cold, but I love the challenge of reigniting the fire. Why are we like this? Why do we do this? Because. Because we are intelligent and we get bored. Because we are insecure and we like the reassurance. Because we are a little bit sick, and we crave the remedy. Because we enjoy the chase of each other, I suspect. It’s the part neither of us wants to ever go completely  cold. We daydream of what everyday could feel like, all while taking turns telling the other why none of this could possibly work. The push and the pull is intoxicating. The surge of emotion and dopamine to two numb and carefully complacent people is like something from a dysfunctional fairy tale. But it’s our fairy tale. The one I love to read, and then be embarrassed of, and then read again, and then slip hands and fingers into forbidden places I would never admit to him… I suspect he knows. And even the fact he says that doesn’t turn him on, makes me want to *do it even more*. Maybe if I do it enough, if I do it right, if the stars align just *so* during a full moon… …I’ll turn him on. He’ll be unable to resist me. And the chase, our favorite game, will begin all over again. Or maybe, (most likely) this entire game exists in my head alone. Even still, it is the favorite game I get to play. The wondering of it trails behind me, like a shadow; just out of sight, but ever present.

Villlain stepped towards Hero careful not to kick off any shingels.

""The sheer amout of heros is nowhere near the amount of therapists-"" ""Hence the Group therapy.""

""I came here to say this is my last fight. Im retiring."" The silence was painful, Villain started to turn when Hero walked to edge of her roof and asked. ""Youre retiring?"" ""Yes. You will be assigned to another villain, and i will live out my days in relative calm.""  Villain walked forwards jumping onto the roof Hero was on each step forward she took. Hero took one back ""Why? What are you planning, what do you to convince me to do?"" Heros suspicion outweighed her jealousy. A few steps forward to make sure her voice wasnt taken by the wind, blowing the smoke closer inbetween them. ""Well what i plan on doing is none of your business and Im not here to convince you of anything darling. Be safe when im gone.""
