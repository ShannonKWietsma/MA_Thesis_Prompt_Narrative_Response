They have the idea to take cat naps anytime, anyplace. They have the idea to ignore the hallucinations and horrible intrusive thoughts and the articles saying that sleep deprivation can lead to long term health problems and an early grave. They have the idea to beat the insomnia with drugs and harming themselves or beat the exhaustion with drugs and harming themselves or beat the world with drugs and harming themselves.

Of course, authors are the seers of reality, and once Steinbeck gave his diagnosis, science moved in. I wonder what they felt back then, when the control panel was revealed to the world. 

The history sites only tell us about the wars that were fought. First, those who wanted control vs those who were against altering the natural order. Then, those who wanted autonomy against those who believed settings should be moderated by Oversight.  

We almost didn’t make it through the autonomy war.  

These days, Oversight intercedes when someone is unable to moderate themselves. They dial down impulses in the criminally minded, dial up empathy in those who are wired to hurt others.   

When I was young, I had a friend who was prone to emotional outbursts. I never knew whether Grey would be happy or sad, angry or elated. I didn’t care. I loved him because of his struggle, not despite it. My parents warned me not to associate with him, that he would only bring me down with him. All I knew was he was beautiful. That he could paint through his pain. That the world was a better place for his creative visions.  

His neurology was incompatible with the chip we all have implanted with the onset of puberty. I tried to help him the same way I’d helped myself. He refused to let me alter his controls.  

Oversight took him away, and when they brought him back, he never picked up a paintbrush again. Six months later, we buried him. 

That was when I realized that Oversight is not the protector I had been taught they were. That there is no place for neurodiversity in the plan they have for humanity.  

I think and I feel. I see potential, not the reality. I live in hope, not fear. I see the world through a lens of color and emotion.  

They will never find out who I really am. 

I walk into the Oversight Institute every day. I sit at my desk. I read through case files. I save the artists.

She was pointing to a small blue object, too distant to make out just yet. But they were traveling pretty quickly, and soon enough his eyes adjusted to the shape as they careened by. It passed below them in a near-blur, becoming distant again behind them in a mere blink of the eye.

''It was a car.''

''Oh.''

The girl then pointed to another object. Red this time. Just as before it was too far to really understand what it was just yet, but soon enough they passed over it and the man was able to smile.

''That,'' he clicked his teeth, ''was a boat.''

''Oh.''

There was nothing for a long time, just the inky black and the sense that they were traveling quickly forwards. She'd long since stopped trying to grab at the nothingness with her little hands for purchase. Their forward motion was perpetual, unending, and if I were to be fully honest, at a relatively safe speed. No more than eighty miles per hour, I assure you.

Her hair streamed behind her by the ever-present wind, and she winced once again as a piece whipped around and slapped her across the eyes. It stung and she was tired of reaching up to fix it.

She didn't understand how the man beside her looked completely still even in all of the wind; if she were older and had a better vocabulary, she'd be able to explain why his stillness unnerved her so much after all this time. But she was only five. And such thoughts weren't conducive to the problem at hand. So she kept reminding herself that it wasn't important and to focus on the bigger things.
Namely, the fact that they had been doing this for far too long, and she was far too tired, and she just wanted to go home. Her mother was probably very angry by now. She was sure she had missed more than one dinner by this point.

She wondered if her dad had made it home. He'd been with her, in the beginning. A lot of people had, actually, but one by one they had dissolved until only she and the man remained. When would it be her turn? She's been so very patient and understanding, why couldn't she just go home too?

''How much longer?'' she whined around a yawn. ''I hate this.''

''Not much longer now,'' the man soothed. If he could, he would have pat her head for comfort. He hated dealing with the tiny ones.

Oh, he wasn't scared of children. He dealt with children all the time. It was just... the tiny ones always made him a little sad. His chest always bloomed with a bruise when he had to take a tiny one. 

The same kind of bruise you would feel in your chest if you were to, say, see a puppy be hit by a semi going one-hundred-twelve miles per hour on the freeway. Graphic? Yes. Mentally scarring? Oh, most assuredly. But you'd also be able to take solace in the fact that it was a quick and sort-of painless death, right? I mean, who really feels being hit by a semi at one-hundred-twelve miles per hour? You're liquefied within seconds. Not much pain in that.

''What's that?''

A purple object.

''Ah,'' the man breathed a sigh of relief. ''That's your stop.''

They were still moving forward, but as the purple object drew close it somehow managed to keep pace with them. It was her dad's car. Flying just as quickly as they were, just below them, in all its grapey glory.

She'd never been happier to see her dad's purple car.

She looked over at the man.

''But how do I st--'' As she spoke the man had turned towards her and raised his leg behind him in a funny way. Like one of the footballer's her mom liked to watch on the television.

And then he kicked her before she could even finish her question. Square in the butt. And she went flying towards--

''She's alive! She's alive!''

Olivia opened her eyes. A man was holding her aloft like a trophy. Her dad's purple car was a blurry blob behind him as he walked up a sharp incline and passed her over to more hands. Her head hurt too much to keep her eyes open so she shut them again. Her head lolled towards the side. Her cheeks stung with the movement, still chapped from the hours of wind.

She was placed on something soft but thin. Everything was too loud. Too bright, even with her eyes closed.

She still felt as if she were flying.

Sure, they weren't exactly native to Hue's small town, but they were sure pretty to look at as you rode by on a bicycle. Kids could be seen picking them the first few days, making tiny, tight-fisted bouquets for their parents or friends. Hue even sat with his little sister Mary and taught her how to make a crown from them by poking a hole in the stem with his nail and pulling another stem through.

It didn't alarm anyone as the flowers spread. Flowers do that. They hopped from one fence to the other, one yard to the next--you could even track their growth by putting your fingers up to your eye. In only a few hours time they'd travel a finger-width, by the next day they'd be four fingers past. And so on and so forth. 

Not everyone liked them; Mrs. Talbot, for example, complained about them every day as Hue walked Mary to school. She'd pull them from her vegetable patch and hold them aloft like she'd finally gotten vengeance and held the head of her worst enemy.  Mr. Lonnie and Mr. Giles, on the other hand, made tea from them they claimed was good for blood circulation and chronic pain. It looked red and smelled terrible.

It took a couple of months for the poppies to cover every inch of grass, choking the life from anything smaller than a sapling. They took over abandoned toys and started to climb fences just around the same time the town called a meeting to address the situation. Regular weed-killers just weren't cutting it and poor Mrs. Talbot had long ago given up the fight--she couldn't pull them out fast enough before more grew to take their place.

Walking Mary to school across concrete sidewalks became piggy-back rides through the growing froth of green and red. The idyllic wonder of a seven year-old was the only thing keeping Hue from the panic that was starting to consume everyone else. 

Some people left, packing up their things and leaving their doors wide open as they drove off into the unknown. But it wasn't just their town. It was the entire county. And it only seemed to be getting worse; the local news kept track with their own special radar. Every day Hue watched the red shape grow wider and wider as it swallowed them up whole.

They had completely taken over by the fifth month. Poppies, a sea of red, black, green, and yellow. Townies had to use machetes to get from one door to the next. Paths were cut daily from house to house, store to store, just so people could get through and live their lives pretending everything was normal. That harmless, thoughtless flowers hadn't taken over and everyone was alright.

The local crops had dried-up. The country was focusing on stopping the spread, not helping the people already affected, and food was scarce as they built a wall to keep the poppies--and the people--in. There were no evacuation efforts. They'd all been left to slowly starve to death.

What wildlife was left had been hunted and eaten. Not even the herbivores could be kept alive subsisting off of only poppies. Fighting was normal, now. Neighbors were no longer helping each other reach their mailbox in the tough tangling vines.

Hue packed up what little they had and took Mary into the last of the trees that used to make up an endless forest. It was eerie, how little noise there was now. No bird calls. No skittering squirrels. Just... quiet.

''What happens when there's no one left?'' Mary asked one night as they stared up at the stars. The trees were gone, left behind somewhere in the miles they'd walked. There was nothing out here except the poppies. At least they made a soft bed.

Hue traced a faint line in the air, connecting one star to another like a connect-the-dots drawing. His stomach growled, low and hungry, but their reserves had long-since dried up. He knew he would have to resort to desperate measures soon.

''I don't know.''

Mary's face, so thin and gaunt now, didn't look right in the darkness. The moon's light bounced off her skin in a way that made her look as if she were glowing from the inside.

''I'm hungry,'' she whispered.

''I know.''

The first chapter starts in the present. Apocalypse in full swing (like day 238 or smth) and then the next chapter jumps to Day 1 to slowly give a gimplse at what happened. Nad somewhere in the middle the timelines ""meet"" and its just one timeline</p>', 'answer': '<h1><b>How to write dual timelines</b></h1><p>Writing a story with dual timelines means that the story is being told from two different perspectives, each happening at another time. The POV can still come from the same person, but often the timelines are being told from the POV of someone else that has a connection to the other timeline and protagonist. The timelines can be only hours apart (often in crime stories) or hundreds of years apart.</p><p>When using your example of a few days apart, I would focus on the commonalities and also the differences that can be seen in just the span of a few weeks. How much has changed and what little things have stayed the same and why?</p><p>Both timelines need a reason for being used in the story. This structure needs to add depth to the plot and it can be used to reveal plot twists and overall enhance the narrative.</p><p>When talking about structure, the stories with dual timelines are often structured in a way that they jump back and forth between the timelines. You can start off by getting the readers invested in one timeline and then start switching it with the other timeline.</p><p>The problem with dual timelines can be that readers are more interested in one timeline then the other. So be careful to give both of them a good enough storyline and purpose for the whole story to be interesting and relevant for the reader.</p><p>So, the most important thing to remember is to find a good balance and to connect the timelines well enough that the flow seems seamless and it shows why both of the timelines are needed for the whole story to unfold.</p><p>Pro tip: Use some aspects (conflict, interests, worries, places, etc.) that are going on in both stories and when switching to the other timeline, carry whatever the first protagonist was doing or thinking over to the second protagonist.</p><p>- Jana</p>",375,wp158r001,#not saying to read my fic but uhhhh #gone to hell is dual timeline and an apocalypse au #sounds exactly like what you’re looking for if you want to see how I’m doing it #apologies if that’s stepping on anyone’s toes #just thought I’d help,meggsngrits,reblog,creativepromptsforwriting,no,yes,no,"submission(question(<p></p>), answer(<h1>title</h1><p></p>))",['text']

They don&rsquo;t want to so they send their friend, Character C, to the date with Character B.</li><li>Same scenario as no. 3, but Character B also send their friend, Character D, instead.</li><li>Character A’s last one night stand ended with a misunderstanding and a lot of awkwardness. To cheer them up again, their friends set them up with a blind date. They meant well, it’s not their fault that it’s the person they had previously slept with.</li><li>It&rsquo;s a social experiment to actually blind date with blind folds on. They can only hear each other&rsquo;s voice and maybe hold hands.</li><li>Character A and Character B go on a blind date and don&rsquo;t hit it off immediately. But they already bought tickets to a concert they both wanted to attend, so they still go together. Maybe they just needed more time to get to know each other.</li><li>A group of friends drunkenly make bets on NYE that they wouldn&rsquo;t be single next year. Now all of Character A&rsquo;s friends have partners and they have less than a month left to find someone. Cue a bunch of blind dates.</li><li>It&rsquo;s a a double blind date and they realize quickly that they actually want to swap their dates.</li><li>Character A is not a kiss and tell kind of person, so their friends start to think that they have been alone for way too long now and set them up with Character B. What the friends don’t know is that they both already know each other – intimately.</li><li>Character A’s friends are obsessed with setting them up with blind dates, and A knows they mean well, but they are just not interested in dating, so they just ask their last blind date, Character B, to fake date them, so A’s friends stop setting them up.</li></ol><p>If you like my blog and want to support me, you can\xa0<a href=""https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2Fcreativepromptsforwriting&amp;t=YTgwYWZjODM3YjQxYWRjY2U2ZjRmMTUzYjI2N2E0OWE5YWU3MzQ5OCw4OGY5OWQyODI0MTQzYjliMzBiZWM0NDE0Y2QzNDRkMDYxOTkzOGE4&amp;ts=1609781402"">buy me a coffee</a>\xa0or\xa0<a href=""https://href.li/?https://ko-fi.com/creativepromptsforwriting/tiers"">become a member</a>!
